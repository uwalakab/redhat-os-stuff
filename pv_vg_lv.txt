## Check of the disk drive devices are available

# lsblk

# parted

(parted) mklabel msdos

(parted) mkpart

(parted) u GiB

# lsblk (see partitions)

# pvcreate /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2

Or if there are several partitions in numerical order..... (E.g. /dev/sdb1 to /dev/sdb5)

# pvcreate /dev/sdb{1..5}

# vgcreate VG_name /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2

OR if you need to set the extent size

# vgcreate -s 32MiB VG_name /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2

Above will create a Volume Group from the Physical Volumes where the extents on disk are 32MiB each (default is 4MiB)

# lvcreate -L 20GiB VG_name

-l|--extents Number[PERCENT]

Specifies the size of the new LV in logical extents. The --size and --extents options are alternate methods of specifying size.
The total number of physical extents used will be greater when redundant data is needed for RAID levels.
An alternate syntax allows the size to be determined indirectly as a percentage of the size of a related VG, LV, or set of PVs.
The suffix %VG denotes the total size of the VG.
The suffix %FREE the remaining free space in the VG.
The suffix %PVS the free space in the specified PVs.
For a snapshot, the size can be expressed as a percentage of the total size of the origin LV with the suffix %ORIGIN (100%ORIGIN provides space for the whole origin).
When expressed as a percentage, the size defines an upper limit for the number of logical extents in the new LV.
The precise number of logical extents in the new LV is not determined until the command has completed.
